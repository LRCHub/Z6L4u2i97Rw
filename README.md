[00:00.49] But it's too late now
[00:03.59] I remember you and me
[00:09.56] And how how careless we could be
[00:25.56] 
[00:14.16] All day
[00:15.83] And all night
[00:17.34] We'd stay up
[00:18.94] It felt so right
[00:26.94] 
[00:20.52] We were so young
[00:22.07] We were so dumb
[00:23.58] We would get drunk
[00:25.10] And then hook up
[00:33.10] 
[00:26.84] We were ok
[00:28.40] We were alright
[00:30.27] Staying awake
[00:31.76] Till the sun rise
[00:40.26] 
[00:33.47] We were in love
[00:34.87] Couldn't stop us
[00:36.33] Like a good drug
[00:38.00] Never enough
[00:44.00] 
[00:39.23] We'd hook up in my car
[00:40.90] Drive it so far
[00:42.52] Play you guitar
[00:43.83] You'd show me your art
[00:45.34] Let down our guards
[00:46.94] Think with our hearts
[00:48.51] Stare at the stars
[00:49.86] We were never apart
[00:59.36] 
[00:51.68] Drinking to young
[00:53.36] Way too much fun
[00:54.99] Out in the sun
[00:56.37] Or in when it's gone
[00:58.25] Took you to prom
[00:59.78] Dance to our song
[01:01.34] Dance all night long
[01:02.72] Till the lights come on
[01:14.22] 
[01:05.03] It's too late now I remember everything
[01:14.08] And how careless we could be
[01:17.78] But it's too late now I remember you and me
[01:27.14] And how careless we could be
[01:41.14] 
[01:30.96] It's too late now I remember everything
[01:50.46] 
[01:40.95] And how careless we could be
[01:46.44] And how careless we could be
[01:52.60] And how careless we could be
[02:06.60] 
[02:05.46] And how careless we could be
[02:19.46] 
[02:18.51] And how careless we could be
[02:32.51] 
[02:22.77] Late nights
[02:23.93] Long fights
[02:25.68] It felt right
[02:26.81] We were alive
[02:33.31] 
[02:28.44] We would go out
[02:29.92] We were so loud
[02:31.41] We were so proud
[02:33.06] We had no doubts
[02:41.06] 
[02:34.96] Weekends
[02:36.55] And weekdays
[02:38.01] We'd spend
[02:39.87] Our own way
[02:45.37] 
[02:41.12] We were careless
[02:42.70] We were fearless
[02:44.23] We were reckless
[02:45.72] Time was precious
[02:54.22] 
[02:47.37] We love to waste time
[02:48.79] Whiskey and wine
[02:50.30] Drinking all night
[02:51.71] Asleep by your side
[03:01.21] 
[02:53.42] Finally alive
[02:55.12] We would just drive
[02:56.90] Never arrive
[02:58.39] Our journey was life
[03:08.39] 
[03:00.16] Staying out late
[03:01.66] Testing our faith
[03:03.14] Running away
[03:04.61] We lived for today
[03:13.61] 
[03:06.37] Young and so bold
[03:08.11] Never get old
[03:09.52] Screw what we're told
[03:11.04] We can't be controlled
[03:22.04] 
[03:16.94] But it's too late now I remember everything
[03:22.11] And how careless we could be
[03:25.65] But it's too late now I remember you and me
[03:34.88] And how careless we could be
[03:48.88] 
[03:38.73] It's too late now I remember everything
[03:47.76] And how careless we could be
[03:54.35] And how careless we could be
[04:00.99] And how careless we could be
[04:14.99] 
[04:13.62] And how careless we could be
[04:27.62] 
[04:26.46] And how careless we could be
[04:40.46] 
[04:35.08] And how careless we could be
[04:49.08] 
[04:43.05] It's too late now
[04:45.46] I remember you and me
[04:51.60] And how how careless we could be
